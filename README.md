# Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA 
Once you've created a training dataset it's important to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA is an approach to analyzing and understanding data. The approach focues on:

discovering patterns
idenitfying anomolies
testing hypotheses
It's critical to ML because it allows you to idenitfy and handle any data quality issues or biases that might affect a model's performance. It also helps researched understand the data set used for modeling better.

EDA is a critical component of your automated ML pipeline and immediately follows your data wrangling phase.

This notebook will provide a template for conducting EDA. Use this notebook as a framework for your ML use cases and training data sets. Remember to customized each EDA approach to its respective use case to get the best insights of your dataset.
